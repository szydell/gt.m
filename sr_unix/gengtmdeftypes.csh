# Create a list of types defined by GTM by reading the header files for types defined there. This allows us to only
# pay attention to these GTM defined structures later when we process compiler pre-processor output where system header
# files will contribute lots of irrelevant definitions. The steps takes are - for each include file:
#   1. Run it through decomment.m which strips comments from the module to ease parsing.
#   2. Run through xtrgtmtypes.awk script which locates typedef statements and records their types (topname and bottom name)
#      recording them in the output file.
#   3. Sort the generated names and eliminate duplicates.

# Drive the big kahuna (scantypedefs) to:
#   1. Read the list of GTM types we want to pay attention to created in the last step.
#   2. Read a list of ignored types which we don't pay attention to because they are irrelevant for our purposes
#      or they cause errors, etc.
#   3. Create a C program with every GT.M include (with some exceptions listed in scantypedefs.m) and
#      run it through the C pre-processor.
#   4. Process the pre-processor output with the awk script stripmine.awk which performs the following actions:
#        a. Eliminates all statements other than "typedef" statements.
#        b. Puts spaces around all tokens, all special chars.
#        c. Eliminates multiple adjacent white space chars to make easy parsing for $ZPiece().
#   5. Reads the created input file, parsing the typedef statements into a structure.
#   6. Resolves types to their simplest types (undoing typedefs)
#   7. Imbedded structures are expanded so each field in a structure is resolved to the maximum point
#      we can de-evolve it to using GTM types and base types.
#   8. Create another C program generating macros to extract information about each field within a struct or union
#      and print it. Information includes name, type, offset, length, and dimension plus overal length and type
#      of the struct.
#   9. Compile and link the created program.
#  10. Run the program.
#  11. Parse the output and fill in the length/offset fields of the structure.
#  12. Write out GTMDefinedTypesInit.m which initializes gtmtypes, gtmstructs, and gtmunions arrays for use by
#      gtmpcat, offset, and eventually perhaps other utilities.
